## Behind the scences

## For bug free implementation
- I have meticulously written test cases for both methods/functions in app.component.spec.ts and for API fetching in api.service.spec.ts. 
- This ensures a bug-free implementation of our project. Achieving 100% code coverage, as specified in the assignment, underscores the thoroughness of our testing. 
- To view the results, you can open the index.html file in the coverage folder generated by the below testing command
   ```bash
   ng test --code-coverage
- This rigorous testing approach guarantees the reliability and quality of our project.

## Technology Stack
![TopicForge (3)](https://github.com/1165CHETAN/fyle-internship-challenge-23/assets/111604779/6ae90410-2f4c-459c-8847-562a6962368f)


- TypeScript : Catch errors early for a more reliable and maintainable project.
- Angular : building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
- Karma + Jasmine : testing tools used in the Angular ecosystem.
- Github : for version control and code hosting.
- Vercel: Deploy your applications with Vercel, a cloud platform for serverless deployment.
 


## Future Improvements
- If given the opportunity to improve the user experience in the assignment, I'd like to introduce a feature displaying forked repositories below each repository's description. 
- Additionally, I plan to implement functionality allowing users to add, modify, and delete repositories using a REST API.
